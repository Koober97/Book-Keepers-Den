# Book Keepers Den

## Website Description 
Have you ever longed to belong to a book club but wary of stepping out of the comfort of your own home? Well look no further because I have the perfect website for you. Book Keepers Den is a book blogging website that allows passionate readers to share their knowledge and love for books of all genres. 

## How it Works
Once the application has been deployed to the user's website people will be required to login/sign up depending on their needs. Once this action has been completed users will have the ability to view the main dashboard on the application. They can click the add button to add new posts or comment under the available posts. Additionally they can add books posted to the dashboard to their wishlist. 

## Tools

Node.js is used to manage the server for the website depending on the platform. <br>
